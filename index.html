<p style="color:skyblue">Profile: Second Year at BSIT.<br>
Love the gadget so always use it. <br>
I am an IT and willing to learn and share my knowledge. <br>
</p>
<p style="color: gray"> Skills: I know how to tinker with things especially when needed. <br>
I know very little about formatting a Laptop, PC, or Phone. <br>
And also somehow I know a little bit about codes that are just like HTML. <br>
