<h1>JEREMIAH ROBLES MENDOZA</h1>
<h2>BSIT 2B</h2>
<p>Objective: I wish with each passing day something new I was learning. <br>
  It's okay when it's hard, because my teacher used to say so. When it is difficult, something new is learned. <br>

<p style="color:blue">Profile: Second Year at BSIT.<br>
Love the gadget so always use it. <br>
I am an IT and willing to learn and share my knowledge. <br>
</p>
<p style="color: gray"> Skills: I know how to tinker with things especially when needed. <br>
I know very little about formatting a Laptop, PC, or Phone. <br>
And also somehow I know a little bit about codes that are just like HTML. <br>
